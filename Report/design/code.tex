\subsection{Code}

Following the verification process, the various pieces of code were adapted and integrated to ensure proper functionality. The resulting implementation was cross-checked against the previous work to confirm that no unintended modifications or errors ("corruptions") occurred during the process.

The final code accepts cladding thickness and plenum height as input parameters and iteratively performs computations until the temperature map converges to a stable solution.

To determine the optimal values for these two quantities, a previously developed genetic algorithm was employed for dimensional optimization.
