\subsection{Code}
After the verification process the different pieces of code had to be adapted to properly work toghether, 
the result of this was compared to the previous work to ensure that nothing was "corrupted" during the process. \\
We have then created a code that takes as input a value of cladding thickness and plenum height 
and will iterativly undergo the computation until the temperature map converges to a stable solution. \\
To dimensition these two quantities a previously implemented genetic algorithm was used. \\
