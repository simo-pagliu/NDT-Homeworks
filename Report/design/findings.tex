\subsection{Findings and Considerations}

During the dimensioning process, it was observed that cladding thickness is highly dependent on the operational time specified in the fitness function. For short cycles, such as one year, the algorithm suggests a thinner cladding, which may not be suitable for long-term operation. Therefore, even when tasked with a one-year design, we opted to base the dimensioning on an expected four-year fuel cycle, which is more representative of fast reactor operation.

This conservative approach ensures greater reliability and safety margins over the lifecycle of the fuel pin. Additional findings and considerations will be added as further analyses are completed.
