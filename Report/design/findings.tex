\subsection{Findings and Considerations}

During the dimensioning process, it was observed that the cladding thickness is highly influenced by the operational time specified in the fitness function. For short cycles, such as one year, the algorithm tends to suggest a thinner cladding, which may not be adequate for long-term operation. To address this, even though the task focused on a one-year design, the dimensioning was based on an expected four-year fuel cycle, which is more representative of fast reactor operation.

This conservative approach ensures enhanced reliability and provides additional safety margins over the lifecycle of the fuel pin. Further findings and considerations will be incorporated as additional analyses are completed.
