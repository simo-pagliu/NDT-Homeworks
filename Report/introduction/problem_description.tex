\subsection{Problem Description}
The fuel pin design problem requires:

\begin{itemize}
\item Determining the cladding thickness, fuel-cladding gap size, and plenum height.
\item Verifying the design against limits for fuel melting, cladding temperature, yielding, and rupture time.
\item Identifying critical aspects if irradiation time is doubled.
\end{itemize}

The project specifications and material properties are mostly given, 
whenever we had missing information we either used data from previous the handouts which were provided and regarder a similar reactor,
or we found the data from the literature.
