\subsection{Problem Description}
The fuel pin design problem involves the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\hookrightarrow$] Determining the cladding thickness, the fuel-cladding gap size, and the plenum height.
    \item[$\hookrightarrow$] Verifying the design against specified limits, including fuel melting, cladding temperature, yielding, and rupture time due to thermal creep.
    \item[$\hookrightarrow$] Identifying critical design aspects if the irradiation time is doubled.
\end{itemize}

Most of the project specifications and material properties were provided. For missing information, data were sourced either from previous handouts related to a similar reactor or from relevant literature.
