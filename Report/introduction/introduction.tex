\section{Introduction}
This report presents the preliminary design and verification of a fuel pin for a sodium-cooled fast reactor, as specified in the assignment.

The analysis involves calculations for material properties, thermal-hydraulic conditions, and mechanical stress limits.

We verify the robustness of our models and justify the assumptions made throughout the process.
