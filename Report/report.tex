% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
This report presents the preliminary design and verification of a fuel pin for a sodium-cooled fast reactor, as specified in the assignment. The analysis encompasses calculations for material properties, thermal-hydraulic conditions, and mechanical stress limits.

The robustness of the developed models is verified, and the assumptions made throughout the process are clearly justified.

\input{./introduction/problem_description} % Problem description
\input{./introduction/assumptions} % Assumptions made

% VERIFICATION
\section{Verification of Models}
Each component of the analysis code was validated to confirm it behaves as expected under the defined conditions. The verification process is detailed in the following sections.

\input{./verification/thermal-hydraulics-analysis.tex} % Thermal-hydraulics analysis
\input{./verification/temperature_profiles.tex} % Temperature profiles
\input{./verification/thermal_expansion.tex} % Thermal expansion
\input{./verification/void_swelling.tex} % Void swelling
\input{./verification/fission_gas.tex} % Fission gas behavior
\input{./verification/restructuring.tex} % Fuel restructuring
\input{./verification/stress_analysis.tex} % Stress analysis

% OTHER EFFECTS
\section{Other Effects}
Additional phenomena, such as Plutonium redistribution and helium embrittlement, are considered to provide a broader understanding of the fuel pin's behavior.

\input{./other/pu_redistribution.tex} % Plutonium redistribution
\input{./other/he_embrittlement.tex} % Helium embrittlement

% DESIGN & CONCLUSION
\section{Design Results and Conclusion}
This section presents the design outcomes, their implications, and the conclusions drawn on the feasibility and safety of the proposed design.

\input{./design/code.tex} % Code implementation
\input{./design/findings.tex} % Findings and observations
\input{./design/results.tex} % Finalized results
