% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
This report presents the preliminary design and verification of a fuel pin for a sodium-cooled fast reactor, as specified in the assignment. \\
The analysis involves calculations for material properties, thermal-hydraulic conditions, and mechanical stress limits. \\
We verify the robustness of our models and justify the assumptions made throughout the process.

% VERIFICATION
\section{Verification of Models}
Each part of the analysis code has been checked to confirm it behaves as expected under the defined conditions.

% OTHER EFFECTS
\section{Other Effects}
Additional phenomena, such as plutonium redistribution and helium embrittlement, 
are considered to provide a broader understanding of the fuel pin's behavior.
