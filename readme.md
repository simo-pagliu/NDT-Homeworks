# Progress

Missing Data: 
- Microscopic cross sections
- Energy per fission

To Fix:
- Power Profile
  
To Do:
- Convertion of fuel qualites
- Temperature profile in cold geometry
- What can we neglect?
- Thermal Expansion
- Temperature profile in hot geometry (with proper neglectionsz)
- Stress calculations

To Test (code-wise):
- 

To Validate (physical result wise):
- Coolant Velociy
- Peak Power
- HTC
- Macroscopic Fission Cross-Section

Done:
- Coolant Density (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/621/1/012028/pdf & https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/14/776/14776927.pdf)

Data we had to get by ourselves:
- Fission Cross section ENDF/B-VI.8
