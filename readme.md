# Progress

Missing Data: 
- 

To Fix:
- Power Profile
- HTC
  
To Do:
- Temperature profile in cold geometry
- What can we neglect?
- Thermal Expansion
- Temperature profile in hot geometry (with proper neglectionsz)
- Stress calculations

To Test (code-wise):
- Power Profile

To Validate (physical result wise):
- Coolant Velociy
- Peak Power
- Macroscopic Fission Cross-Section

Validated:
- Sodium Coolant Density, Viscosity, $C_p$

Data we had to get by ourselves:
- Fission Cross section ENDF/B-VI.8
- Energy per Fission
