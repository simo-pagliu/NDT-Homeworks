# Progress

To Fix:
- Power Profile (Ask professors for help)

To Find data on:
- Fuel roughness
- Cladding roughness
- Fuel Emissivity
- Cladding Emissivity
- Cladding hardness (only if we have to consider contact between fuel and cladding)
  
To Do:
- Temperature axially varies --> For hot geometry take it into account
- Temperature profile in cold geometry
- Temperature profile of the coolant along the axis
- Temperature profile of fuel axially
- What can we neglect?
- Thermal Expansion
- Temperature profile in hot geometry (with proper neglectionsz)
- Stress calculations

To Test (code-wise):
- Power Profile

To Validate (physical result wise):
- Coolant Velociy
- Peak Power
- Macroscopic Fission Cross-Section
- K coolant
- HTC cladding-coolant
- Contact heat transfer is negligible (hp: if they don't touch in the hot geometry then it's good)
- Coolant thermal resistance
- Cladding thermal resistance
- Gap thermal resistance
- Fuel thermal resistance

Validated:
- Sodium Coolant Density, Viscosity, $C_p$

Data we had to get by ourselves:
- Fission Cross section ENDF/B-VI.8
- Energy per Fission
